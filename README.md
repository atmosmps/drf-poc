- [ ] Add documentation to run project

## Positive points

- Itâ€™s a flexible and extensible toolkit used to build Web APIs in Django;
- Many libraries (maintained and stable) being maintained by the community;
- Features like the browseble api that make development easier;

## Negative points

- Django Framework overflow 
    - The Django Rest Framework works on top of the Django Framework layer, it is not an idenpendent library,
    but a layer library that allows you to build a Rest API using the Django framework;
- By choosing to use drf, the developer is stuck with the django ecosystem, not being able to choose to use modules
such as ORM other than the one provided by Django itself, for example.
